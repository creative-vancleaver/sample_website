    <P>
        The <a href="https://www.softcover.io">Softcover</a> Publishing Platform was designed mainly for eBooks like the <a href="https://railstutorial.org/book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em>book</a> and <a href="https://learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a>, but its also good for making more traditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby Dick</em>. We present below a short and affectionately irreverent book report on the classic of American literature.

        <em>Moby Dick</em></a> by Herman Melvile begins with these immortal words:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago &mdash; never mind how long precisely &mdash; having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interestme on shore, I though I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulatin the circulation
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            After driving off his spleen (wich <em>can't</em> be good for you), Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who &mdash;<em>spoiler alert!</em>&mdash; is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
